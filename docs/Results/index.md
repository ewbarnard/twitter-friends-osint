## Contribution Policy: Disinformation Concerns

If our project were to *only* help with teaching OSINT skills, we'd have little concern.
"How to do X," assuming X is legal, should not be controversial. On the other hand, posting
links to information coming from a bad actor *is* a problem. 

So, one possibility is to not link to any research at all. But that is missing the point!
We're all looking for things that are connecting the dots; that's why we're all interested
in pitching in and learning how to *help* connect said dots.

No doubt we'll need to have some sort of policy in place (formal or informal). We should
ideally have a "deza committee" to act as gatekeeper - but we're not prepared to place
such an onus on anyone. As this grows, someone mutually acceptable will see the need and
step up.

## Contribution Policy

This is the suggested initial policy. We're open to suggestion.

- This project does not *host* research. We only host contributed "how to" training of
  a non-controversial nature, e.g., "How to do X."
  
- This project does *link* to research, by category, but with the **_source_** or **_author_**
  clearly identified. It's up to you, the reader, to know whether the source/author is a
  bad actor. Our project owners certainly don't claim to know!
  
- Anyone can recommend removal of links to stuff on the grounds of it being disinformation.

- We don't want to be the reason for people feuding.
