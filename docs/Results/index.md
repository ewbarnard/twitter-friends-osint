# Results: Research, Documents, Amazing Stuff

**We have a thorny issue here.** How do we link to information without
linking to disinformation? I don't think any single person can be the gatekeeper
of what is "good" info and what is not.

My suggested policy (for now): Anyone can suggest any specific item be removed,
and it will be. We're not trying to link to *everything*, so this might be a
clean-enough approach.
