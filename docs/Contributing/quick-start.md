# Quick Contribution Guide for the Impatient

1. Poke around this site. Decide on what you want to contribute.
   Decide where it should fit-in on this site.
   
1. Learn markdown syntax. It's very simple. Search for "markdown tutorial"
   and/or take the site tour on our [Contributing](index.md) page.
   
1. Type up your contribution as one or more plain text documents (.txt file)
   using markdown syntax.
   
1. Send Ed or Tom the stuff you are contributing. Our Twitter handles are on
   the front page of this site. Tell us where you think your stuff should fit.
   
## "Proper" Open Source Contribution

Here is the better procedure for contributing. It means *you* do more of the work
to get things place properly in the project.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account.

1. "Fork" the project. That means GitHub makes a copy of the project to your account.
   
1. Edit your copy of the project, adding your material. If you wish, ask the
   Project Coordinators (Ed or Tom) to take a look at your copy of the project.
   
1. Submit a "pull request" to this project. We (the project coordinators) will
   review the request.
   
1. Once all is well, we will accept the pull request, adding your contribution to
   the project. GitHub automatically records you as a project contributor.
