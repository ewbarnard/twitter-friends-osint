> **_I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE RIGHT NOW. TELL ME. QUICKLY:_** [Click here for the short version](quick-start.md)

Everything here is written using "markdown". It's just plain typing, with a few conventions
for adding titles/headings and formatting Web links.

## Tutorials

There are lots of Markdown tutorials available online. Do a google search for:

- markdown basics
- markdown tutorial
- markdown tutorial github

Here is one: [Markdown Guide - Getting Started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Initially it will be fine to send a plain text file in Markdown format. If you're using
Microsoft Word, export the document as plain text.

## Examples

Browse around our repository on GitHub. The link is at the bottom of this page,
or go here: [https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint). Once there, browse into the
[docs](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/tree/master/docs)
directory. Click on [index.md](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/blob/master/docs/index.md),
which is the site main page in "markdown" format.

Once you have reached `index.md`, click on the "raw" button to see the
[index.md page content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/master/docs/index.md). That's what the main page looks like as a Markdown file.

You should also see this file, `index.md`, when you browse
to the `Contributing` folder inside
the `docs` folder.
Again, click on the "raw" button, and you can see what this file looks like.

## Contributing to the Project: Tutorials

Everyone is going to need a different level tutorial based on their own experience and
background, or lack thereof. We *welcome* folks who are *not* tech-savvy!

Some tutorials to consider. If/when you get stuck, do google searches to get answers,
and/or ask us on Twitter. We'll do our best to help!

## Contribution Policy: Disinformation Concerns

If our project were to *only* help with teaching OSINT skills, we'd have little concern.
"How to do X," assuming X is legal, should not be controversial. On the other hand, posting
links to information coming from a bad actor *is* a problem. 

So, one possibility is to not link to any research at all. But that is missing the point!
We're all looking for things that are connecting the dots; that's why we're all interested
in pitching in and learning how to *help* connect said dots.

No doubt we'll need to have some sort of policy in place (formal or informal). We should
ideally have a "deza committee" to act as gatekeeper - but we're not prepared to place
such an onus on anyone. As this grows, someone mutually acceptable will see the need and
step up.

## Contribution Policy

This is the suggested initial policy. We're open to suggestion.

- This project does not *host* research. We only host contributed "how to" training of
  a non-controversial nature, e.g., "How to do X."
  
- This project does *link* to research, by category, but with the **_source_** or **_author_**
  clearly identified. It's up to you, the reader, to know whether the source/author is a
  bad actor. Our project owners certainly don't claim to know!
  
- Anyone can recommend removal of links to stuff on the grounds of it being disinformation.

- We don't want to be the reason for people feuding.
