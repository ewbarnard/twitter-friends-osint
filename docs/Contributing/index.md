# Contributing

Everything here is written using "markdown". It's just plain typing, with a few conventions
for adding titles/headings and formatting Web links.

## Tutorials

There are lots of Markdown tutorials available online. Do a google search for:

- markdown basics
- markdown tutorial
- markdown tutorial github

Here is one: [Markdown Guide - Getting Started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Initially it will be fine to send a plain text file in Markdown format. If you're using
Microsoft Word, export the document as plain text.

## Examples

Browse around our repository on GitHub. The link is at the bottom of this page,
or go here: [https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint). Once there, browse into the
[docs](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/tree/master/docs)
directory. Click on [index.md](https://github.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/blob/master/docs/index.md),
which is the site main page in "markdown" format.

Once you have reached `index.md`, click on the "raw" button to see the
[index.md page content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewbarnard/twitter-friends-osint/master/docs/index.md). That's what the main page looks like as a Markdown file.

You should also see this file, `index.md`, when you browse
to the `Contributing` folder inside
the `docs` folder.
Again, click on the "raw" button, and you can see what this file looks like.
