# Outside Resources for Learning OSINT

I've turned these up in a simple google search. They have *not* been vetted, and need to be.

- [What are the best resources for learning about Open Source Intelligence?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-resources-for-learning-about-Open-Source-Intelligence)
- [Jane's Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Training](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/consulting-open-source-intelligence-training-osint.html) - I included this to point out that many training programs currently exist and we do not want to be infringing on anyone's Intellectual Property rights.
- [OSINT Framework](http://osintframework.com/) is a GitHub project "focused on gathering information
  from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost. I originally created this framework with an information security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec."
