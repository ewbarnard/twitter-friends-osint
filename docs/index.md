## About Us

Is there some way to **teach** open source intelligence techniques (OSINT)?

Over on Twitter we have a number of citizen journalists chasing down details,
publicly available plane numbers, all sorts of things. If we could teach each
other how we each do OSINT or other research, can we do even better?
"Many hands make light work."

This project does *not* aim to coordinate researchers. Nor do we aim to directly publish
OSINT research results or findings. Authors generally prefer to publish and control
their own work in any event. We do plan to *link to* published findings, discussions,
twitter threads, and articles.

In software development, the way to be a "10X developer" is not to type ten times
faster. No, the way is to mentor ten people and bring them up to your level.

## Project Aim

This project aims to act as a focal point for anyone willing to
share or teach their skills, techniques, related to OSINT or citizen journalism.

We aim to:

- Teach research techniques
- Provide curated links to more resources
- Share tips and tricks learned in practice

## Project Coordinators

- Ed Barnard, Twitter [@ewbarnard](https://twitter.com/ewbarnard)
- Tom Barton, Twitter [@tbarton0925](https://twitter.com/tbarton0925)

Neither of us are OSINT experts. We'll be learning along the way!
We do have experience in technical writing, information security,
and software projects.

## You Can Contribute

Do you have:

- Tips or techniques you're willing to share? Could you write a tutorial?
- Links to existing online resources teaching OSINT?
- Links to germane OSINT research (such as online articles, reports, twitter threads)
  that should be shared?
  
### Supporting the Active Researchers
  
Not everyone is an experienced writer. Would you be interested in cleaning up or
filling in other peoples' contributions? Those who are actively sharing OSINT with
the rest of us likely don't want to take the time to teach what they are doing.
But if *we* can take quick "I do this and then this" hints and turn them into real
tutorials for others, we're doing the community a huge service.

### OSINT Hub

There are a **lot** of Twitter threads out there, blog articles, background material,
etc., related to these investigations. Wouldn't it be great to have a central
**annotated** index of all these interconnected threads? Since GitHub Pages do get indexed
by Google, any resource we create becomes searchable via google. Thus it would be
useful to have a *description* for each link or thread.

Basically, every time someone shouts, "Hey FBI (or Mueller), you should see this," we
can add an annotated link to that, in our repository. Would you like to help out by
contributing these annotated links?

## How To Contribute

GitHub is built for collaboration. We can accept as many contributors as are interested.
However, GitHub also assumes that you are "tech savvy." If you are, great:

 > Fork the project, do your thing, and submit a pull request. Lots of tutorials are out there
   telling you the specific steps needed to accomplish your objective.
   
But *this* project is aimed at our Twitter friends, and many of us won't be familiar with
GitHub. Just contact Tom or Ed on Twitter (links above), or join this Twitter thread:

We need to create a proper "How to Contribute" document, and tutorials for using GitHub.
If you're an OSS (Open Source Software) person and could help with these basic
"getting started" documents, please do! We also need a "Code of Conduct" document.
